<h1>An√°lisis multivariado de los datos<a class="headerlink" href="#analisis-multivariado-de-los-datos" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p>En esta secci√≥n se realiza el an√°lisis multivariado del proyecto, la idea detr√°s de dicho apartado es identificar efectos simult√°neos que diferentes variables predictoras podr√≠an tener sobre el target. Por un lado, el estudio multivariante permitir√≠a determinar posibles efectos indirectos que una predictora puede tener sobre el target, a partir de un tercer <em>feature</em>. Por otro lado, ayudar√≠a a encontrar posibles correlaciones no despreciables entre variables independientes que sugerir√≠an la eliminaci√≥n de alguna de ellas en pos de reducir la complejidad del modelo.</p>
<p>La secci√≥n se estructura de la siguiente manera. En primer lugar, realizamos la carga de las librer√≠as que vamos a utilizar como el dataset objetivo. Este √∫ltimo ser√° reducido al per√≠odo de tiempo que corresponde al grupo de entrenamiento, cuya explicaci√≥n de la creaci√≥n de este subconjunto de datos se di√≥ en el <a class="reference external" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yY5Z5Sr65W-V0U5Xm_v1Iri0S9_E08_s#scrollTo=xUxe8UqFzGEG"><strong>an√°lisis bivariado</strong></a>. En segundo lugar, se crean tres variables categ√≥ricas que interesan incorporara al an√°lisis multivariado. Los mismos son los siguientes:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Variable binaria que indique si la variaci√≥n interdiaria del precio del bitcoin es positiva o no</p></li>
<li><p>Shock Covid-19</p></li>
<li><p>Ingreso de ethereum al <em>exchange</em> Binance</p></li>
</ol>
<p>La primera hace menci√≥n a la variaci√≥n entre dos d√≠as del precio de bitcoin. Como vimos en an√°lisis anteriores, el precio del bitcoin est√° considerablemente asociado positivamente al precio de ethereum y puede ser un importante predictor directo de la cotizaci√≥n futura del target. La pregunta ahora ser√≠a si hay un efecto indirecto entre el precio actual de ambas criptomonedas que puede correlacionar con la cotizaci√≥n futura de ethereum, es decir, interesa analizar si la cotizaci√≥n de bitcoin tiene un efecto en el precio actual de ethereum que podr√≠a relacionarse con los movimientos futuros de esta criptomoneda.</p>
<p>En el segundo caso, el shock ex√≥geno del covid-19 gener√≥ una disrupci√≥n importante tanto en el √°mbito cotidiano de las personas como en los mercados financieros. Siguiendo a <a class="reference external" href="https://elpais.com/economia/2020-03-12/las-bolsas-sufren-en-la-apertura-y-el-ibex-cae-mas-de-un-5.html"><strong>El Pa√≠s</strong></a>, el 12 de marzo del 2020 se recuerda como un ‚Äúterremoto econ√≥mico global de una magnitud impredecible‚Äù, con el desplome global de las bolsas a partir de los pron√≥sticos poco alentadores acerca de la trayectoria de las econom√≠as post-covid. Debido a esto, en esta secci√≥n queremos ver qu√© rasgos podr√≠amos encontrar al separar la base en dos momentos diferentes, un per√≠odo pre-covid y uno post-covid. Eligiendo al 12 de marzo del 2020 como momento bisagra.</p>
<p>Por √∫ltimo, un segundo quiebre que queremos analizar se encuentra en el posicionamiento de ethereum como una inversi√≥n globalmente popular dentro del mercado de criptomonedas y su relaci√≥n con otras variables correlacionadas altamente con otros predictores. Para ello, utilizamos como <em>proxy</em> la fecha en donde se funda <a class="reference external" href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/115000599831"><strong>Binance</strong></a>, una de las plataformas m√°s grandes e importantes de <em>trading</em> de criptomonedas.</p>

<p>Como se puede ver en el gr√°fico anterior, los resultados no sugieren un efecto indirecto de la variaci√≥n interdiaria del bitcoin en la cotizaci√≥n futura de ethereum, a trav√©s del precio actual de ethereum. De hecho, las distribuciones son bastantes similares a√∫n diferenciando por la categ√≥rica de si el precio entre d√≠as de bitcoin subi√≥ o no. El gr√°fico podr√≠a indicar que ser√≠a casi indiferente entre incluir la cotizaci√≥n del precio presente del bitcoin como el de ethereum.</p>

<p>En contraste, la separaci√≥n de per√≠odos pre y post pandemia no resulta indiferente al evaluar la correlaci√≥n entre el precio presente de ethereum y su cotizaci√≥n futura. Claramente, la correlaci√≥n entre variables se da en los tramos de menores precios en contexto de pandemia, lo que indica no s√≥lo que dicho acontecimiento global contrajo los precios de la criptomoneda, sino que la pandemia podr√≠a influenciar negativamente el precio corriente de ethereum y afectar as√≠ la cotizaci√≥n futura de la misma. Debido a esto, resulta imporante agregar dicha variable binaria al an√°lisis.</p>

<p>A√∫n m√°s interesante resulta la influencia que podr√≠a darse entre el per√≠odo pre y post pandemia con la correlaci√≥n entre el precio m√°s alto del d√≠a de bitcoin con la cotizaci√≥n futura de ethereum. El gr√°fico anterior sugiere un cambio de trayectoria de la correlaci√≥n entre ambas variables. Dada una cotizaci√≥n del precio m√°s alto de bitcoin se generan dos niveles de precios distintos seg√∫n qu√© per√≠odo se est√° evaluando, por lo que la categor√≠a <em>shock-covid</em> se correlaciona indirectamente con el precio futuro de ethereum, a trav√©s de bitcoin. Lo mismo ocurre en el gr√°fico siguiente, donde en vez de utilizar el primer rezago del target se grafica el rezago 7, es decir, el precio eth del mismo d√≠a pero de la siguiente semana.</p>
